# PulpitRockVR
Small proof of concept VR app where you can fly around Lysefjorden and see Preikestolen with a hot air balloon. The purpose of this VR concept was to explore how open terrain data could be used to visualize vast areas, and in return, make it explorable and interactive in VR.

The map is based on a heightmap of a 3D modeled terrain imported into Blender using terrain data from OSM (OpenStreetMap). In Blender, the terrain 3D model was applied a custom black and white depth shader, that allowed for easier adjustment of the relatives heights in terrain.

As of now the concept isn't available for testing, but that might change soon.
